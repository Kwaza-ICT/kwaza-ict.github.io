# Cloud Native Architecture

1 – Cloud native technology is important because it removes roadblocks to innovation.

# AutoScaling

1 - Vertical scaling: Adjusting the resources (CPU, memory) of existing instances.
2 - Horizontal scaling: Adding more instances, apps and replicas.
3 – Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically adjust the number of pods in a deployment based on CPU utilization.
4 – Cluster Autoscaler: Automatically adjust the number of nodes in a cluster based on CPU utilization.

# Serveles

1 - Serverless computing: Running code without having to provision or manage servers.

# Community and governance

1 - CNCF: Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
2 - CNCF makes decisions through public discussion and voting.

# Organizational Personas

1 - Organizational personas are roles that describe the work of managing cloud native applications.
2 - Site Reliability Engineer (SRE): Responsible for creating and maintaining SLOs and SLIs.

# Open Standards

1 - Open Container Initiative (OCI): A community-driven open standard for container images.
