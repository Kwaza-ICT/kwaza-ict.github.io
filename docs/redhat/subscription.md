# Red Hat subscriptions

## About

**subscription-manager** is the command-line based client for the Red Hat Subscription Manager tool.

The Subscription Manager performs several key operations:

* It registers machines to the Red Hat entitlement service and adds the machine to the systems inventory. Once a machine is registered, it can receive updates based on its subscriptions to any kind of software products.
* It lists both available and used (consumed) subscriptions.

* It allows administrators to both subscribe and unsubscribe a system from specific subscriptions.

## Check subscription

```shell
subscription-manager list
```
