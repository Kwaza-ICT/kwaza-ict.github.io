# How to upgrade from 13 to 14

First, you have to check what is your minor version on 13, because I strongly recommend you go to the latest minor version of 13 before jump to 14

## Note

If you are running GitLab on Ubuntu 16, then jumping from 13 to 14 will not be possible since GitLab does not provide such repository.

### Migrate to hashed storage

In GitLab 13.0, hashed storage is enabled by default and the legacy storage is deprecated. GitLab 14.0 eliminates support for legacy storage.

### List projects using hashed storage

```shell
# Projects
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:storage:hashed_projects
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:storage:list_hashed_projects

# Attachments
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:storage:hashed_attachments
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:storage:list_hashed_attachments
```

### Migrate to hashed storage

```shell
sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:storage:migrate_to_hashed
```

### If you encounter some issues running the migrate to hashed command, then a workaround is

```shell
wget -O /tmp/fix-legacy-hashed-storage-migration.rb https://gitlab.com/snippets/2039252/raw 2
gitlab-rails runner /tmp/fix-legacy-hashed-storage-migration.rb
```

### DB migration is required

You have to do the DB migration yourself in order to finish the upgrade process. Check the [db migration](docs/gitlab/db-migration.md)
