# What is GenAI?

AI that's generate new content like text, image, audio and video. 

## Examples

Example of GenAI are GPT-3, DALL-E, OpenAI Codex, etc.

## GenAI Concepts

- **Tokenization:** Converting raw text into tokens.

## Why we should tokenize

 - Tokenization convert it into a format that the model can understand.
 - It creates a mapping between the raw input text and the model vocabulary.

## Context window

- It's the number of tokens that the model considers when generating the next token.
- It helps the model to understand the context of the input text.
- Accuracy and relevance: The context window helps the model to generate more accurate and relevant output.
- Cost and performance: The context window affects the cost and performance of the model.

## Embedding

- It's the process of converting tokens into vectors.
- Vectors have a high dimensionality to capture many features for one input token.
- Embedding models can power search applications.
