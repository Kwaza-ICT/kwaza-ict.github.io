# Training Data

 - We must have a good data
 - Garbage in => Garbage out
 - Critical part to build a good model
 - Several options to model our data
 - Labeled vs unlabeled data
 - Structure vs unstructured data

## Labeled data

Data that has been tagged with one or more labels. Used to train supervised machine learning models

## Unlabeled data

Data that has not been tagged with any labels. Used to train unsupervised machine learning models

## Structure data

Data that is organized in a specific format, such as a table or a database. Used to train structured machine learning models

 - Tabular data
 - Time series data

## Unstructured data

Data that does not have a specific format, such as text, images, or audio. Used to train unstructured machine learning models

## Types

 - Regression: Predict a continuous value
   - Predict the price of a house
 - Classification: Predict a category
   - Predict whether an email is spam or not

## Training vs Validation vs Test set

 - Training set: Data used to train the model
 - Validation set: Data used to tune the model hyperparameters
 - Test set: Data used to evaluate the model performance

## Feature Engineering

The process of using Domain knowledge to select and transform raw data into meaning. 

 - We can do feature Engineering on structured data

## Unsupervised Learning (K-mean)

 - No labeled data
 - Data set contains only features
 - Usage (isolation Forest)
   - Market basket analysis
   - Fraud detection

## Semi supervised Learning

 - Small amount of labeled data
 - Huge amount of unlabeled data
 - Generate humans label without humans

## Reinforcement Learning

 - Learn from the environment
 - Learn from the feedback
 - Learn from the reward
 - Usage
 - Game playing
 - Robotics
 - Self driving cars
