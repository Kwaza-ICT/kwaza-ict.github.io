# CloudFront

CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service provided by AWS. It speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so content is delivered with the best possible performance.

## Key Features

- **Global Reach**: CloudFront has a large number of edge locations around the world, which helps ensure that your users receive your content with the lowest latency.
- **Security**: CloudFront integrates with AWS Shield for DDoS protection and AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) for application security.
- **High Performance**: CloudFront uses a global network of edge locations to cache and deliver your content with low latency.
- **Cost-Effective**: CloudFront offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model with no upfront fees or long-term contracts.
