# Cost management

## Concepts

### Capital Expenses (CapEx)

Capital expenses (CapEx) are funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, buildings, or equipment. CapEx is often used to undertake new projects or investments that will help the company grow or maintain its competitive position in the market.

### Operational Expenses (OpEx)

Operational expenses (OpEx) are the ongoing costs that a company incurs to run its day-to-day operations. OpEx includes expenses such as rent, utilities, salaries, and other costs that are necessary to keep the business running. OpEx is typically considered a cost of doing business and is deducted from revenue to calculate net income.

### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

Total cost of ownership (TCO) is the total cost of acquiring, operating, and maintaining an asset over its entire lifecycle. TCO includes the initial purchase price of the asset, as well as ongoing costs such as maintenance, repairs, and operating expenses. TCO is used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different investment options and to make informed decisions about resource allocation.

### Return on Investment (ROI)

Return on investment (ROI) is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment. ROI is calculated by dividing the net profit of an investment by the initial cost of the investment and expressing the result as a percentage. A positive ROI indicates that an investment is profitable, while a negative ROI indicates that an investment is not profitable.
