# Deploy infrastructure across multiple AWS accounts

## StackSets

AWS CloudFormation StackSets extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation. StackSets are useful when you need to deploy a common set of AWS resources across multiple accounts and regions.

## Service catalog

AWS Service Catalog allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services that are approved for use on AWS. These IT services can include everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier application architectures.

## Output

 - Control infrastructure and App Code together
 - Provision in many accounts with StackSets
 - Create portfolios of approved products
