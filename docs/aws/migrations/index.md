# Migrations

This section contains information about the migrations that are available for the AWS provider.

## Migratoin Strategies

There are several migration strategies that you can use when moving workloads to AWS:

- **Rehosting (Lift and Shift)**: Rehosting involves moving applications from on-premises to the cloud with minimal changes. This approach is typically used when you need to quickly migrate workloads to the cloud without making significant modifications to the application architecture.
- **Replatforming (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)**: Replatforming involves making some optimizations to the application architecture during the migration process. This approach is used when you want to take advantage of cloud-native features and services to improve performance, scalability, or cost efficiency.
- **Repurchasing (Drop and Shop)**: Repurchasing involves replacing existing applications with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software or software as a service (SaaS) solutions. This approach is used when you want to reduce maintenance costs, simplify operations, or take advantage of new features provided by third-party vendors.
- **Rearchitecting (Rebuild)**: Rearchitecting involves redesigning and rebuilding applications to take full advantage of cloud-native features and services. This approach is used when you want to modernize legacy applications, improve scalability and performance, or enable new capabilities that were not possible in the on-premises environment.
- **Retiring**: Retiring involves decommissioning applications or workloads that are no longer needed. This approach is used when you want to reduce costs, simplify operations, or consolidate redundant systems.
- **Retaining**: Retaining involves keeping existing applications or workloads in their current state without making any changes. This approach is used when you have legacy applications that cannot be easily migrated to the cloud or when the cost of migration outweighs the benefits.

## Cloud Adoption Framework

### Business

 - Creation of a strong business case for cloud adoption
 - Business goals are congruent with cloud objectives
 - Ability to measure benefits (TCO, ROI, etc.)

### People

 - Evaluate organizational roles and structures, new skills and process needs and identify gaps
 - Incentives and Career management aligned with evolving roles
 - Training options appropriate for learning styles and needs

### Governance

 - Portfolio management geared for determining cloud eligibility and priority
 - Program and project management more agile projects
 - Align KPIs with newly enabled business capabilities

### Platform

 - Resource provisioning can happen with standardization
 - Architecture patterns adjusted to leverage cloud native
 - New application development skills and processes enable more agility

### Security

 - Identity and access management models change
 - Logging and audit capabilities are enhanced
 - Shared responsibility model is understood and implemented

### Operations

 - Monitoring and management tools are cloud aware
 - Automation is used to reduce manual intervention
 - Incident response and change management processes are updated
