# TOGAF

The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) is a widely used framework for enterprise architecture that provides a comprehensive approach to designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information technology architecture. TOGAF is based on the concept of an Enterprise Continuum, which represents the evolution of an organization's architecture from the current state to the target state.

## A: Architecture Vision

The Architecture Vision phase is the initial phase of the TOGAF ADM cycle and involves defining the scope, objectives, and stakeholders of the architecture effort. The Architecture Vision document outlines the high-level goals and objectives of the architecture initiative and provides a roadmap for achieving them.

## B: Business Architecture

The Business Architecture phase focuses on defining the business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes of the organization. The Business Architecture document describes the current and target state of the business architecture and identifies the key business drivers and requirements that will guide the development of the architecture.

## C: Information Systems Architecture

The Information Systems Architecture phase focuses on defining the information systems architecture that will support the business architecture. The Information Systems Architecture document describes the current and target state of the information systems architecture and identifies the key information systems and technologies that will be used to implement the architecture.

## D: Technology Architecture

The Technology Architecture phase focuses on defining the technology architecture that will support the information systems architecture. The Technology Architecture document describes the current and target state of the technology architecture and identifies the key technology components and standards that will be used to implement the architecture.

## E: Opportunities and Solutions

The Opportunities and Solutions phase focuses on identifying opportunities for improving the architecture and developing solutions to address them. The Opportunities and Solutions document describes the key opportunities and challenges facing the architecture initiative and outlines the solutions that will be implemented to address them.

## F: Migration Planning

The Migration Planning phase focuses on developing a detailed plan for migrating from the current state to the target state. The Migration Planning document describes the migration strategy, roadmap, and timeline for implementing the architecture and identifies the key activities, resources, and dependencies that will be required to complete the migration.

## G: Implementation Governance

The Implementation Governance phase focuses on establishing governance mechanisms to ensure that the architecture is implemented successfully. The Implementation Governance document describes the governance structure, processes, and controls that will be used to monitor and manage the implementation of the architecture and ensure that it meets the desired outcomes.

## H: Architecture Change Management

The Architecture Change Management phase focuses on managing changes to the architecture and ensuring that it remains aligned with the business goals and objectives. The Architecture Change Management document describes the change management process, roles, and responsibilities that will be used to assess, prioritize, and implement changes to the architecture.
