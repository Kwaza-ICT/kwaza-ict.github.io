# Hybrid Architectures

Hybrid cloud architectures combine on-premises infrastructure with cloud services to provide a flexible and scalable environment that can meet the needs of different workloads. This approach allows organizations to leverage the benefits of both on-premises and cloud resources, enabling them to optimize performance, cost, and security based on specific requirements.

 - Hybrid Architectures make use of cloud resources along with on-premises resources
 - Very common first step as a pilot for cloud migrations
 - Infrastructure can augment or simply be extensions of on-prem platforms - VMWare, for example
 - Ideally integrations are loosely coupled - meaning each end can exist without extensive knowledge of the other
